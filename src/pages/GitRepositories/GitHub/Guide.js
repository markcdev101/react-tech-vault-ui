      GitHub is a popular platform for version control and collaboration, enabling developers to work together on projects from anywhere. It leverages Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code and manage project history efficiently. Developers can create repositories, commit changes, and collaborate using features like pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions for automation. Whether you're working on open-source projects or managing private repositories, GitHub provides tools to improve code quality, streamline workflows, and enhance team collaboration.
