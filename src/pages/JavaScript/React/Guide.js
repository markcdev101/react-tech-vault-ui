      React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It enables developers to create reusable UI components and manage application state effectively through its component-based architecture. With React's virtual DOM and efficient diffing algorithm, applications achieve high performance and responsiveness. By leveraging Reactâ€™s ecosystem, including tools like React Router and Redux, developers can build scalable and maintainable applications with ease.
